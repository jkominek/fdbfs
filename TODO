1 unify some of the code between rename and unlink
2 implement the correct behavior for unlink, so that deleted files
  aren't actually removed until the last user is gone
3 actually use pid table, and check validity of use records
4 maybe be more resilient in the face of failures to insert use records
5 permissions checking
6 locks
- ensure start_liveness has inserted our PID entry before we start taking
  FUSE operations
