Overall key scheme:

=== inodes ===
prefix 'i' inode              -> contains basic attrs and symlink info
prefix 'i' inode \x00 lock    -> info on whoever has the lock
prefix 'i' inode \x00 pending -> info on parties waiting for lock?
prefix 'i' inode \x01 pid1    -> per fuse-process use counter (64 bit LE)
prefix 'i' inode \x01 pid2    -> per fuse-process use counter (64 bit LE)
prefix 'i' inode \x02 xattr0  -> arbitrary number of extended attributes
prefix 'i' inode \x02 xattr1
prefix 'i' inode \x02 xattr2
prefix 'i' inode 'd' filenameA-> dirents.
prefix 'i' inode 'd' filenameB
prefix 'i' inode 'd' filenameC
prefix 'i' inode 'f' offset0 -> plain block, may be shorter than blocksize if ends in nulls
                             -> totally null blocks can be omitted
prefix 'i' inode 'f' offset2 'z'\x01\x00 -> block compressed with whatever algorithm is assigned to \x00
prefix 'i' inode 'f' offset3 'p'\x02\x00... -> key contains 512 bytes of parity for the block 
    there should be only one kv pair within a given offset(n) to offset(n+1)
    range.

we should probably move the dirent and filedata subspaces out, so that
the entire inode space can be scanned, for fsck purposes, without reading
all information in the filesystem.

=== garbage ===
prefix 'g' inode -> indicates that nlinks in the inode has gone to zero,
                    and it should be check periodically for all of the
		    usage to have gone to zero, at which time it can be
		    cleared.

=== pid table ===
prefix 'pl' pid1  -> status of a given fuse process
prefix 'pl' pid2

the status should include an incrementing counter as a heartbeat,
and some host information. each process should update its heartbeat
every reasonable timeout amount of time. (30-60 seconds?)

if processes notice that another pid's entry has stopped updating,
they should delete it. the GC process can confirm the liveness of
all pids it encounters when cleaning up inodes.

=== meta ===
prefix 'M' -> metadata block. filesystem version and blocksize?


inode record
* INodeRecord
* any information necessary for non-file/non-directory things
* contents mutable
* definitely not portable

directory entry
* DirectoryEntry protobuf message
* inode value
* (struct stat).st_mode & S_IFMT
* contents are immutable
* may not be portable
